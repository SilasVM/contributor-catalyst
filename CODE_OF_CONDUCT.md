## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. The goal of our program is to foster 
supportive mentorship, personal development, and lasting connection between peers. 

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but 
it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few 
ground rules that we ask people to adhere to.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Django project or Django 
Software Foundation. This includes IRC, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, DSF events, 
and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. 
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to 
participate within them.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (mentors, contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occuring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Our Standards

We strive to create a positive learning and working environment through inclusive and supportive behavior. 

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Be friendly and patient
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
  
By choosing to engage with our community, you commit to aligning with our values and expectations for behavior.

## Reporting Guidelines
If you believe anyone is in immediate physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first. (In Santa Cruz, dialing 911 is the best way to do this, on- or off-campus. If you are unable to call, you can also text 911 as outlined [here](https://police.ucsc.edu/about/directory.html). For non-emergency situations, please submit a report as outlined below and community organizers will notify law enforcement if necessary.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. **For in-person, after-hours support, you can contact UCSC's Safety Dispatch Office Line: (831) 459-2100**. Community Safety Officersties (CSOs) are visible in campus residential communities from 7pm to 3am nightly, and may also be approached for help.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible:
- Emily Lovell (she/her) : emme@soe.ucsc.edu
- Stephanie Lieggi (she/her) : slieggi@ucsc.edu

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to the community organizers listed above. If a report involved a community organizer - or you would feel more comfortable reporting to someone else at UC Santa Cruz - you may also reach out to:
- Lorato Anderson (she/her), _Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Graduate Studies_ (lodander@ucsc.edu)
- Jarett Haley (he/him), _Retention Specialist, Office for African, Black, Caribbean Student Success_ (jdhaley@ucsc.edu)
- Ariana Yancey, _Graduate Student Intern, Office for African, Black, Caribbean Student Success_ (ayancey@ucsc.edu)

The identity of any individuals involved in a report will remain confidential, unless consent is given or required by campus procedures or by law. 

In your report please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.
